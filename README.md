Hello Andrew,

I have reached Korea yesterday. After getting good idea about my schedule, I only could find this suitable time slots considering Korea time is ahead of PST by 17 hrs --- 
1) Friday 7 Feb -  Korea Time - 8:00-10:00 AM  (i.e PST  Thursday  6 Feb 3:00-5:00 PM)
2) Saturday 8 Feb - Korea Time - 8:00 - 12: AM (i.e PST Friday 7 Feb 3:00-7:00 PM)

And also, I do not have cell phone here. So I would suggest we can have this over Skype may be? My Skype id is - kaustubh303

​​
Let me know if this is possible.
Thanks & Regards
~Kaustubh
